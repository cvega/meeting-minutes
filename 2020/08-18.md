### Notes

- Carol has been reviewing JEP for cell id change
- JEP for cell id meeting was a small group of us. We got to a potential path forward for everyone. Challenge is to keep the JEP scoped small.
- Why haven't cell ids been added already? Historically there was not consensus about how to approach this problem (2017-2018). Now there seems to be more willingness to adopt and more awareness of what's needed by several people.
- Matt updated papermill and scrapbook from master to main branches
- Conda build for papermill is broken. Not sure why yet.
- Safia been using zeit (now named vercel) deployments. We needed to upgrade everything from 1.0 to 2.0 (we might have missed the slack box update?)
- .NET team at Microsoft have been integrating Data Explorer (yay!). Rendering issues with SVG inside HTML outputs for cells in JLab/Classic.
- .NET team has feedback about Semiotic packaging. They opened a github issue about the problem. Sounds like it's a typing issue with the introduction of TypeScript.
- Rohit has all the slugs for testbook updated to `testbook` (readthedocs, PyPI). Are we distributing on conda? Not yet, I need to walk Rohit through how to do that.
- Can we get an asset for testbook? Fabricio [All logos](https://github.com/nteract/logos). Safia to reach out about it.
