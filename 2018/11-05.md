- **Safia's updates**: Howdy everyone! Here's what I did last week.

  1. I finished making updates to the existing component docs. If you go to components.nteract.io you will see complete docs for everything.
  2. Sent out our **October newsletter** and created a user survey for our documentation effort.
  3. Migrated MathJax to typescript.

  This week I will be:

  1. Migrating more components to TypeScript and moving them as I go along.
  2. Working on developing collateral to show concrete ways businesses interested in nteract can invest in us.
  3. Working through more business development ideas. I created the #biz-dev channel to plan our things there. Join me there if you'd like to help out.
