**October 22, 2018 Updates**

*   **[Bookstore](https://github.com/nteract/bookstore)**: Contents services for version control, publishing, and scheduling
*   **nteract.io**: Refactor of nteract.io mostly by John Detlefs. 
*   **Speaking**: John Detlefs will be speaking about nteract in Austin tomorrow (history of data notebooks; tech/non-tech users; broaden the audience to be more inclusive). _Go John!_
*   **Typing**:Moving to TypeScript from flow-type to simplify typing. Better support.
*   **IPython integration test suite**: We should find a better (or a) solution.
*   **Projects**: We've begun setting up Projects for a kanban style of project management. See [https://github.com/orgs/nteract/projects](https://github.com/orgs/nteract/projects). We are using it as an org level.
*   [Project 9](https://github.com/orgs/nteract/projects/9): Details added to the [Roadmap google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDixHwNCWoPDUKeAmlR3q5c6ty1YklXuL2z53pL2lN4/edit)
*   **Data explorer** bringing in blueprint.js buttons and other UI bits: [nteract/nteract#3484](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/3484)

**Action items**

*   Better integration tests with IPython releases
*   Deep link to Data Explorer so folks can try a demo without the need to install nteract
*   Data Explorer - update the icon for axes to minimize confusion from the right angle. More emphasis on what is x or what is y.
*   Semiotic into nteract org discussion
