## Overview

* @aterrel is hoping to find a project during the sprint that will take a few hours, as a good way to get started.

* There's an issue with the babel config. @rgbkrk feels it was his mistake and wants to address it before the sprints. ðŸ˜¬  This impacted external usage our our libraries and even production usage of commuter.

* @mseal pointed out that papermill has issues with process and kernel management, processing logs, and creating robust failure modes. Fixing some of these would be great Sprint projects! Some of these are part of nbconvert and may need fixes within jupyter. On top of this, papermill needs a changelog.

* To help with advocacy around papermill, we'd love to show off workflows and use cases around papermill to help people see ways to use it. One way of disseminating these could be with screencasts.

* @mpacer suggested that we do a demo of how to use ScreenFlow (for screen casting) at the Sprints, and recommended doing an artist's studio to collaborate and edit each otherâ€™s videos. People seem really on board with recording these while at the sprints!

* @emeeks suggested doing a Twitch or Youtube Live video as well to be more dynamicPeople seem really on board with recording these while at the sprints.
