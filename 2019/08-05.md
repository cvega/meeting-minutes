### nteract, design, outreach, and website [SA]

*   Designer pushed out some initial mockups. They can be viewed in the **design** Slack channel
*   Minor **commuter** release was pushed and published
*   **Play** repo was reverted to JS only as the TypeScript refactor of nteract introduced some regressions. A PR was opened to move to version 2 Zeit zero configuration deployment.
*   **nteract.io** also was moved to version 2 Zeit zero configuration. This is in preparation of a Zeit profile of nteract as a long time user.
*   **nteract**: An issue was opened for comment about Selectors API to make it easier for users to create from the existing components for projects other than notebooks. Please comment. This should make things friendlier to use and to improve the way we represent state as well.


### Hydrogen [BR]

*   Time spent recently onboarding new contributors. YAY!
*   Regular maintenance and triage mode right now for the project


### Bookstore [MP]

*   Opened a number of PRs to add support cloning for local and network attached file systems like EFS
*   Peter Volpe, Netlix infra, and Carol have been reviewing M's PRs
*   All is looking good for a 2.4.0 Bookstore release later today


### Repo gardening, minimal-plotly [CW]

*   Archived approx 10 inactive nteract repos
*   Minor edits to org page: added a description and reordered the six pinned repos (UI top row; Data workflow bottom row)
*   Updated minimal-plotly and will release 1.49.1 today


### Action Items
